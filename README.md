# Final_Project

-Brief description of your project
Our project completes different types of Math functions, split into three main categories: simple calculations through GUI, Graphing functions of the first and second degree, and solving Algebraic equations.

-List of Working features / Things I should test
Simple Calculator:
The functions on our GUI calculator. They have all been tested but sometimes have issues when multiple functions are carried out one after another. 

Graphing:
Various functions for x to both the first and second degree. Make sure to input integers only!

Algebra:


-List of unresolved bugs
Simple Calculator:
When you overload the calculator with many functions in a row, it can sometimes return the wrong answer. It is intended to be used mostly for simple functions. Originally a test of our GUI skills, it was not the focus of our work.

Graphing:
The input fields must be filled out with integers only. Additionally, all of the ones for either a Line or a Quadratic must be filled out for the program to work.


Algebra:



-Directions on how to compile and run your code 

If you compile and run the file called "Driver.java", you will be given instructions on how to proceed. Simply input one of three keywords: "calc" for the basic calculator, "graph" to graph equations, or "algebra" to solve algebraic equations. The Driver constructs the necessary window for you to carry out the tasks you need. 


-Directions on how to use your program

For the Simple Calculator, just use it as you would a regular calculator.

For the Graphing Calculator, either input a slope and a y intercept for the Line Graphing portion, or input A, B, and C values for the Quadratic portion. The graph will clear each time before you attempt to graph a new function. 

For the Algebra Calculator
